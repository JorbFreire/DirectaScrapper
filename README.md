# Directa Scraper

This is a script to make it easier to generate similar invoices less repetitively.

Only works on this one city's system. This is a fast-code automation to solve a single issue and does not intend to be a robust or generic solution at any moment.

However, it can work as a show-off for similar issues.

For now, the only way to use it is by reading the code, manually editing some parts of it as you need and then copy-pasting into the browser's console in a window with the Directa system open.
(probably even less productive than just using the system manually by now)


### Motivation:

Directa's page really sucks.
It looks like they tried their best to make the task of filling a simple form as hard as they could without making it obvious that they intend to make it harder
